                 aspect is important because most present difficulties
                 in this field do not involve the theoretical question
                 of whether certain things can be done, but rather the
                 practical question of how can they be accomplished well
                 and simply. The teaching of computer science could be
                 made more effective by various alterations, for
                 example, the inclusion of a laboratory course in
                 programming, the requirement for a strong minor in
                 something other than mathematics, and more practical
                 coding and less abstract theory, as well as more

                 more enormous, but not stronger. Inherent defects at
                 the most basic level cause them to be both fat and
                 weak: their primitive word-at-a-time style of
                 programming inherited from their common ancestor, the
                 von Neumann computer; their division of programming
                 into a world of expressions and a world of statements;
                 their inability to effectively use powerful combining
                 forms for building new programs from existing ones; and
                 their lack of useful mathematical properties for
                 reasoning about programs. An alternative functional
                 style of programming is founded on the use of combining
                 forms for creating programs. Functional programs deal
                 with structured data, are often nonrepetitive and
                 nonrecursive, are hierarchically constructed, do not
                 name their arguments, and do not require the complex
                 machinery of procedure declarations to become generally

  abstract =     "My 1971 Turing Award Lecture was entitled ``Generality
                 in Artificial Intelligence.'' The topic turned out to
                 have been overambitious in that I discovered I was
                 unable to put my thoughts on the subject in a
                 satisfactory written form at that time. It would have
                 been better to have reviewed my previous work rather
                 than attempt something new, but such was not my custom
                 at that time. I am grateful to ACM for the opportunity
                 to try again. Unfortunately for our science, although
                 perhaps fortunately for this project, the problem of
                 generality in artificial intelligence (AI) is almost as
                 unsolved as ever, although we now have many ideas not
                 available in 1971. This paper relies heavily on such
                 ideas, but it is far from a full 1987 survey of
                 approaches for achieving generality. Ideas are
                 therefore discussed at a length proportional to my
                 familiarity with them rather than according to some
                 objective criterion. It was obvious in 1971 and even in
                 1958 that AI programs suffered from a lack of
                 generality. It is still obvious; there are many more
                 details. The first gross symptom is that a small
                 addition to the idea of a program often involves a
                 complete rewrite beginning with the data structures.
                 Some progress has been made in modularizing data
                 structures, but small modifications of the search
                 strategies are even less likely to be accomplished
                 without rewriting. Another symptom is no one knows how
                 to make a general database of commonsense knowledge
                 that could be used by any program that needed the
                 knowledge. Along with other information, such a
                 database would contain what a robot would need to know
                 about the effects of moving objects around, what a
                 person can be expected to know about his family, and
                 the facts about buying and selling. This does not
                 depend on whether the knowledge is to be expressed in a
                 logical language or in some other formalism. When we
                 take the logic approach to AI, lack of generality shows
                 up in that the axioms we devise to express commonsense
                 knowledge are too restricted in their applicability for
                 a general commonsense database. In my opinion, getting
                 a language for expressing general commonsense knowledge
                 for inclusion in a general database is the key problem
                 of generality in AI. Here are some ideas for achieving
                 generality proposed both before and after 1971. I
                 repeat my disclaimer of comprehensiveness.",

                 the most widely used programming model today,'' they
                 were given the A.M. Turing Award. (From the ACM press
                 release on February 6, 2002).\par

                 Kristen Nygaard was to give his Turing Award Lecture at
                 OOPSLA 2002 on Simula and its development. Simula was
                 originally designed as a simulation language, with the
                 purpose of supporting analysis of large and complex
                 systems. Because of this, the modelling capabilities of
                 languages always have been central to the Scandinavian
                 school of object orientation.",

  abstract =     "Perhaps the most disturbing ``trend which became
                 reality'' over the last 25 years has been a
                 recharacterization and professing of the various
                 computing fields as though Computer Science and
                 Software Engineering have actually been invented and
                 can be taught in ways that parallel fields such as
                 physics and structural engineering. This is ``science
                 \& engineering envy'' pure and simple!\par

                 The result is that so much of what is taught in high
                 schools and universities looks backwards?not for
                 historical interest, which is almost absent, or even to
                 great ideas of the past?but (a) to emphasize what all
                 too often have been workarounds for what we don't yet
                 know how to do, and (b) to substitute vocational
                 training for real knowledge and perspective.\par

                 One of the most interesting characteristics of
                 computing in the best universities of the 1960s was
                 that the professors told the students that nothing much
                 of importance was known, and it was the duty of all to
                 try to invent a real computing science and software
                 engineering. This was a very healthy attitude and led
                 to many good starts towards qualitatively better
                 approaches to our exciting area of interest. Just as
                 ``civilization'' is not a place or state, but a process
                 of people who are trying to be more civilized, real
                 computing is the process of people trying to make a
                 better notion of computing. The most progress will be
                 made by young people who have been encouraged to
                 criticize old conceptions and invent new ones with an
                 elevated notion of what constitutes a high threshold
                 for a good idea.\par

                 It is the duty of all enfranchised computerists to help
                 this happen. Since our paths of thinking are so
                 conditioned by the early environments we put so much
                 effort into learning, it is of critical importance to
                 pay the highest attention to the introductions to our
                 field for children, young adults and college students.
                 This talk is about how we might introduce computing to
                 beginners to help them see the real beauties and
                 possibilities of our field in a way that will both get
                 them fluent in the small amout of good stuff that is
                 known, and most importantly to encourage them to make
                 qualitative improvements in computing.",

  abstract =     "Turing Lecture from the winners of the 2007 ACM A. M.
                 Turing Award.

                 In 1981, Edmund M. Clarke and E. Allen Emerson, working
                 in the USA, and Joseph Sifakis working independently in
                 France, authored seminal papers that founded what has
                 become the highly successful field of model checking.
                 This verification technology provides an algorithmic
                 means of determining whether an abstract
                 model---representing, for example, a hardware or
                 software design---satisfies a formal specification
                 expressed as a temporal logic (TL) formula. Moreover,
                 if the property does not hold, the method identifies a
                 counterexample execution that shows the source of the
                 problem.

                 The progression of model checking to the point where it
                 can be successfully used for complex systems has
                 required the development of sophisticated means of
                 coping with what is known as the state explosion
                 problem. Great strides have been made on this problem
                 over the past 28 years by what is now a very large
                 international research community. As a result many
                 major hardware and software companies are beginning to
                 use model checking in practice. Examples of its use
                 include the verification of VLSI circuits,
                 communication protocols, software device drivers,
                 real-time embedded systems, and security
                 algorithms.

                 The work of Clarke, Emerson, and Sifakis continues to
                 be central to the success of this research area. Their
                 work over the years has led to the creation of new
                 logics for specification, new verification algorithms,
                 and surprising theoretical results. Model checking
                 tools, created by both academic and industrial teams,
                 have resulted in an entirely novel approach to
                 verification and test case generation. This approach,
                 for example, often enables engineers in the electronics
                 industry to design complex systems with considerable
                 assurance regarding the correctness of their initial
                 designs. Model checking promises to have an even
                 greater impact on the hardware and software industries
                 in the future. --- {\em Moshe Y. Vardi,
