	\addalphanumberedsinglerow{}{The unique and always existing \msrcode{actMsrCreator} actor instance (named here \msrcode{theCreator}) requests the initialization of the system and its environment (made of one administrator identified here by \msrcode{bill}), one activator actor (identified by \msrcode{theClock}) and indicating that the number of communication company actor instances for the system's environment is 4 (one of them is identified here by \msrcode{tango})}
	\addalphanumberedsinglerow{}{the administrator logs in to initialize a coordinator}
	\addalphanumberedsinglerow{}{an alert is received. Time is goind one without having the coordinator handling the alert which let's the proactive actor trigger the automatic sollicitation of crisis handling.}
	\addalphanumberedsinglerow{}{this first part stops before the coordinator logs in the system.}
